    You can use the [NOAA declination calculator](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination)
    to calculate the declination in heading from magnetic north to true north. Use negative numbers
    for east and positive numbers for west. Range is +/- 180.0, numbers outside that range will
    wrap around.

    If you'd like to indicate some other direction, you can then calculate the declination of your
    chosen waypoint vs. true north at your location. Keep in mind that the distance between you and
    your waypoint can have a profound effect on the declination error introduced by moving around;
    as such, this setting is not useful for indicating nearby waypoints.
