The prototype\r\nuses 8 vibration motors and is powered by an Arduino Nano.\r\n\r\nThis repository contains libraries and sketches designed to work with the HaptiCap.\r\n\r\n## HaptiCapMag\r\nWhile the original and primary goal of the *HaptiCap* was to act as a haptic compass (continuously\r\nsignaling north), I have not ruled out using the form factor for other directional feedback. For forward compatibility, I've decided to call the general haptic feedback interface (the hat)\r\n*HaptiCap*, and the version that is acting as a haptic compass is called the *HaptiCapMag*.\r\n\r\nThese sketches assume that your HaptiCap uses an HMC5883L 3-axis digital magnetometer, and that\r\nyou are using [my HMC5883L library](https://github.com/pganssle/HMC5883L), which is stored in a\r\nseparate repository in case someone wants to use it for non-HaptiCap applications. Full\r\ndocumentation for my HMC5883L library can be found in that repository or online [here](https://pganssle.github.io/HMC5883L/documentation/).\r\n\r\nA full writeup on the device is coming soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
