This page should cover in general detail how to build your own HaptiCap; in designing the prototype, I made many practical choices about what components to use, and how to arrange them - these are not necessarily the optimal way to do things for your own use case, and I recommend playing around with my design to try to improve upon it. Wherever possible, I'll try to indicate why I've made the choices I made.
