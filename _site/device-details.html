<h1>
    Device Details
</h1>

<p>The <a href="instructions.html">instructions section</a> explains <em>how</em> to build a HaptiCap like my prototype, while this section gives details on the choices I made and <em>why</em>, which can often help when improving devices for your own use case or situation.</p>

<h3 id="vibration-motors">Vibration Motors</h3>

<h4 id="casing">Casing</h4>
<p>I bought the motors I’m using some time ago and I don’t remember the exact model number. I would guess that nearly any small DC vibration motors should work, so long as you can supply the appropriate current and voltage. One problem with most bare vibration motors is that the unbalanced weight is exposed, and the rotation can easily be stopped by mild pressure.</p>

<p>In order to use it in the HaptiCap, it needs to be in a rigid shell. If you have a 3D printer available, you can make a custom shell, but I’ve found that – at least with the motors I have – the diameter of the motors almost exactly matches the inner diameter of a pencil tube, and so I was able to make 8 shells but cutting up a disused mechanical pencil.<sup><a name="fnote1" href="#ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Another alternative is to use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Diameter-Button-3V-4-5V-CellPhone-Vibrator/dp/B00H4PM1WO">button type vibration motor</a>, which already has a rigid casing. I have some of these but I have not tested them yet, so I am not sure if the vibration is strong enough to be of use in this application.</p>

<h4 id="current-draw">Current draw</h4>
<p>In the motors I’m using, I’ve measured a resistive load of ~25 Ω, and assuming they are designed to work with 3 V, that’s a constant current draw of 120 mA with a 100% duty cycle. This is considerably more than the 40 mA specified in the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardNano">Arduino Nano spec</a>, so it may be best to try a design using a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9056">multiplexer</a> rather than using the output pins directly<sup><a name="fnote2" href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. </p>

<span class="caption">Thermal image of the Arduino Nano after several hours of continous use.</span>
</div>

<p>I’m actually using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-Nano-v3-0-Compatible-Arduino/dp/B00761NDHI/">SainSmart Nano 3.0</a> (Arduino clone), and empirically it seems to be capable of providing around 100 mA of current, and in practice I tend to run the motors with close to a 50% duty cycle, so the continuous draw is generally ~50 mA. Using a thermal camera, I noticed that the processor runs a bit hot (~60 °C), but this is not uncomfortable, and doesn’t seem to be causing any damage to the processor itself.</p>

<p>Interestingly, either the microcontroller is extremely inefficient at supplying power to the motors or the motors are <em>not</em> the largest source of current draw in the system (I strongly suspect the former). Even running with a 50% duty cycle (updated every 20 ms), a freshly charged 1800 mAH battery only lasts about 5.5 hours, indicating that the current draw is close to 325 mA, while the motors are only drawing an average of ~ 50 mA. I plan to investigate this with a current probe and some experiments with the algorithms to determine what the main cause of current draw is to try and get the current draw closer to 100 mA.</p>

<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>
<ol class="footnotes">
<li><a href="#fnote1">^</a> I couldn't find my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_tool">Dremel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_wheel#Cut_off_wheels">cut-off wheels</a>, so I heated up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_knife">box-cutter</a> with a lighter to rapidly cut the plastic.
<li><a href="#fnote2">^</a> This is also useful if you have a microcontroller with fewer outputs than you have motors - the Nano has 8-14 digital outputs (depending on how you want to count). A digital multiplexer can control 8 motors with 3 digital I/O pins, and 16 motors with 4 digital I/O pins.
